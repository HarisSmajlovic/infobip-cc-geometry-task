Given n rotating line segments of length 1m in a plane and the following constraints:
    - Each line segment kicks off its rotation from a vertical position and rotates around its lower endpoint.
    - Each line segments makes a full circle in 2pi seconds.
your goal is to find the sorted list of time intervals (within a [0, 2pi] period) in which any of the segments is within the rotation circle of any other line segment.

*Example I/O here*

Expected runtime complexity: O(nlogn)
Worst case complexity: O(n ** 2) - (NOT nlog(n + k), where k is the number of intersections!!!)
